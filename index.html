                    Born in Armenia, Colombia in 1992 I have been in the United States since 2002.
                    In the time since arriving to the United States, I attended Clay High School from 2008 to 2011.
                    After graduating with honors, I was accepted into, and attended, the University of Central Florida.
                    At the University of Central Florida I majored in biomedical sciences and graduated in the summer of
                    2016.
                    From that point onward, I worked as a Medical Assistant for three years before choosing to pursue a
                    career in technology.
                    Now I am attending the University of Central Florida Web Developer Coding Bootcamp in the hope of
                    beginning a new, and successful, journey.

                    In my own time I love to read, play tennis, and explore Orlando with my girlfriend.
                    I have an eight month old mixed puppy that is as beautiful as she is sweet.
                    Owning a dog has been a challenge but one that has come with its own rewards.
                    Recently, my girlfriend and I became Disney Annual Pass holders.
                    I was skeptical of buying an annual pass at first but have come to love the relaxing aspect of going
                    whenever we want.
                    Life is changing fast and adapting to the shifting times has me looking forward to the future.
